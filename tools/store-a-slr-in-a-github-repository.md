# ☁ Store a SLR in a GitHub repository

To store a systematic literature review in a GitHub repository, you can follow these steps:

#### **Step 1: Create a GitHub Account**

If you don't have a GitHub account, sign up for a free account on GitHub's website (https://github.com/) and follow the registration process.

#### **Step 2: Create a New Repository**

1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. Click the "+" sign in the top right corner of the GitHub homepage and select "New repository."
3. Fill in the repository details:
   * Repository name: Choose a descriptive name for your literature review project.
   * Description: Provide a brief description of your project.
   * Choose a visibility option (public or private, depending on your preference and privacy needs).
   * Initialize this repository with a README: Check this option to create an initial README file.
4. Click the "Create repository" button.

#### **Step 3: Add Your Systematic Literature Review Materials**

Once your repository is created, you can start adding your literature review materials:

1. **README**: Your README file is an essential component of your repository. It should provide an overview of your systematic literature review, including the research question, methodology, and a brief guide on how to navigate your repository. You can edit the README file directly on the GitHub website by clicking the "Edit" button on the README file.
2. **Data and Documents**: Create folders for your data and documents related to the literature review. For example:
   * **Data**: Upload datasets, Excel files, or any structured data you've collected or analyzed.
   * **Documents**: Upload literature review articles, reports, or any textual materials.
3. **Code**: If you have any scripts or code used in your literature review, create a separate folder for them.
4. **References**: Consider creating a folder for storing reference files, citation styles, or any other related reference materials.

#### **Step 4: Collaborate and Manage Version Control**

GitHub offers excellent collaboration and version control features. Here's how you can effectively use them:

* **Invite Collaborators**: To work with others on your literature review, invite collaborators by going to the "Settings" tab of your repository, selecting "Collaborators & teams," and adding their GitHub usernames or email addresses.
* **Branches**: Use branches to work on different aspects of your literature review independently. Create branches for specific tasks or analyses to keep your work organized.
* **Pull Requests**: When you want to merge changes from a branch into the main branch, create a pull request. Reviewers can provide feedback, and once approved, you can merge the changes into the main branch.
* **Documentation**: Continuously update your repository with new findings, data, and code changes. Document your research process, share insights, and encourage collaboration among contributors.

By following these steps and utilizing GitHub's version control capabilities, you can efficiently store and collaborate on your systematic literature review materials in a well-organized and accessible manner.

Certainly, let's delve into more details on how to save a systematic literature review in GitHub with a hypothetical case study.

### **Case Study: Saving a Systematic Literature Review in GitHub**

#### **Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository**

Assume you're conducting a systematic literature review on the topic of "Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare." Here's how to create a GitHub repository for your review:

1. **Create GitHub Account**: If you don't already have one, sign up for a GitHub account.
2. **Create New Repository**:
   * Log in to your GitHub account.
   * Click the "+" sign in the top right corner and select "New repository."
   * Fill in the details:
     * Repository name: "AI-in-Healthcare-Literature-Review."
     * Description: "Systematic literature review on the use of AI in healthcare."
     * Visibility: Choose public or private as per your preference.
     * Initialize with a README: Check this option.
3. **Create Repository**: Click the "Create repository" button.

#### **Step 2: Organize Your Repository**

Now that your repository is created, it's time to structure it for your literature review:

1.  **README.md**: Start by editing the README file to provide an overview of your systematic literature review project. Describe the research question, objectives, and methodology. Here's an example:

    ```markdown
    # AI in Healthcare Literature Review

    This repository contains materials related to a systematic literature review on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare. 

    ## Research Question

    What are the key applications, challenges, and future trends of AI in healthcare?

    ## Methodology

    - Data collection and analysis
    - Search strategy and inclusion/exclusion criteria
    - Data extraction and synthesis

    ## Structure

    - `data/`: Contains datasets and extracted data.
    - `documents/`: Includes research papers, reports, and other relevant documents.
    - `code/`: Stores scripts and code for data analysis.
    - `references/`: Houses reference files and citation styles.

    For more details, refer to the documentation in each folder.
    ```
2. **Data**: Create a folder named `data/` to store your datasets, Excel files, or any structured data used in your review.
3. **Documents**: Create a folder named `documents/` for storing the literature review articles, reports, and any textual materials you collect or generate.
4. **Code**: If you have scripts or code used in your analysis, create a folder named `code/` to house them.
5. **References**: Consider creating a folder named `references/` where you can store reference management files, citation styles, or any related reference materials.

#### **Step 3: Collaborate and Document Your Work**

Collaboration and documentation are key to a successful literature review:

* **Collaborators**: Invite collaborators to your repository if you are working with others. They can contribute to data analysis, review documents, and provide input.
* **Branches**: Use branches for different aspects of your review. For example, you can create branches like `data-analysis`, `data-extraction`, and `manuscript-writing` to organize your work.
* **Pull Requests**: When you or your collaborators are ready to merge changes or contributions, create pull requests. Reviewers can provide feedback before merging.
* **Continuous Updates**: Continuously update your repository with new findings, data, code changes, and documents as your literature review progresses. Use commit messages to describe the changes made.

By following these steps, you'll have a well-structured GitHub repository for your systematic literature review, making it easier to collaborate, track changes, and share your research progress with others. Remember to adhere to ethical guidelines and respect copyright when handling literature review materials.
