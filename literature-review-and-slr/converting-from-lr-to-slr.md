# Converting from LR to SLR

Transforming a traditional Literature Review into a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) requires a structured approach to enhance rigor, objectivity, and transparency. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to make this conversion:

**1. Define Specific Research Questions:**

* Start by clearly defining specific research questions or objectives that you want to address through the SLR. These questions should guide the entire review process.

**2. Develop Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:**

* Establish precise inclusion and exclusion criteria that align with your research questions. Criteria should specify the types of studies, publication sources, study designs, and other relevant factors.

**3. Conduct a Systematic Literature Search:**

* Perform a systematic and comprehensive literature search using relevant databases, academic search engines, and library resources. Document your search strategy, including search terms and filters applied.

**4. Select and Screen Studies:**

* Apply your predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria to systematically screen and select studies. Ensure that the screening process is consistent and conducted by multiple reviewers for reliability.

**5. Data Extraction:**

* Develop a structured data extraction form to collect relevant information from selected studies. This may include study characteristics, methodology, results, and other key data points.

**6. Quality Assessment:**

* Assess the quality and validity of each selected study using standardized tools or criteria. This step ensures that only high-quality research contributes to your SLR.

**7. Data Synthesis:**

* Synthesize the extracted data systematically. Depending on your research questions, this may involve statistical analysis, meta-analysis, or thematic synthesis. Present the findings in an organized and transparent manner.

**8. Reporting in Accordance with SLR Standards:**

* Adhere to established SLR reporting standards, such as PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Ensure that your review follows these guidelines for transparency and reproducibility.

**9. Address Bias and Objectivity:**

* Implement strategies to minimize bias, such as using multiple reviewers, documenting decisions, and conducting sensitivity analyses. Maintain objectivity throughout the process.

**10. Document the SLR Methodology:** - Clearly document the entire SLR methodology, including search strategies, selection criteria, data extraction, quality assessment, and synthesis methods. This documentation enhances the review's credibility.

**11. Review and Iterate:** - Continuously review and refine your SLR process. Seek feedback from peers or experts to improve the quality and rigor of your review.

**12. Conclude and Discuss Implications:** - Summarize the findings of your SLR and discuss their implications for the research field. Highlight any gaps in knowledge and suggest areas for future research.

By following these steps, you can convert a traditional Literature Review into a well-structured Systematic Literature Review, ensuring a more rigorous and evidence-based approach to your research synthesis.

### **A Case Study in IoT (Internet of Things)**

**Step 1: Define Specific Research Questions**

* **Literature Review (Initial Stage):** In the initial Literature Review on IoT, the researcher's focus was on understanding the general landscape of IoT technologies, applications, and challenges.
* **Conversion to SLR:** To convert this into an SLR, the researcher defined specific research questions. For example: "What are the security challenges in IoT devices?" and "What are the emerging trends in IoT applications?" These questions will guide the systematic review process.

**Step 2: Develop Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria**

* **Literature Review (Initial Stage):** In the Literature Review, the researcher included various types of sources, such as articles, reports, and blog posts, without strict criteria.
* **Conversion to SLR:** To conduct an SLR, the researcher developed precise inclusion and exclusion criteria. For instance, they decided to include only peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers published in the last five years to ensure the most current research is considered.

**Step 3: Conduct a Systematic Literature Search**

* **Literature Review (Initial Stage):** The initial Literature Review involved a basic search of IoT-related terms in popular search engines without a structured search strategy.
* **Conversion to SLR:** For the SLR, the researcher conducted a systematic literature search using academic databases (e.g., IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library) with a carefully crafted search strategy. The strategy included specific keywords, Boolean operators, and date filters to ensure comprehensive coverage.

**Step 4: Select and Screen Studies**

* **Literature Review (Initial Stage):** In the initial review, the researcher selected studies based on relevance and interest, potentially introducing bias.
* **Conversion to SLR:** In the SLR, the researcher followed a structured screening process. They used predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria to systematically select studies, ensuring transparency and minimizing bias.

**Step 5: Data Extraction**

* **Literature Review (Initial Stage):** Data extraction in the initial review may have involved summarizing key points from selected sources without a structured approach.
* **Conversion to SLR:** In the SLR, the researcher developed a standardized data extraction form to systematically collect relevant information from each selected study. This form included fields for study details, methodology, findings, and quality assessment.

**Step 6: Quality Assessment**

* **Literature Review (Initial Stage):** Quality assessment of studies may have been limited or absent in the initial review.
* **Conversion to SLR:** To ensure rigor, the SLR included a quality assessment step. The researcher used established quality assessment tools to evaluate the validity of each selected study.

**Step 7: Data Synthesis**

* **Literature Review (Initial Stage):** Data synthesis in the initial review might have involved summarizing findings narratively.
* **Conversion to SLR:** In the SLR, the researcher conducted a systematic data synthesis, potentially using meta-analysis or thematic analysis, to provide evidence-based conclusions.

**Step 8: Reporting in Accordance with SLR Standards**

* **Literature Review (Initial Stage):** Reporting in the initial review may have followed standard academic writing conventions without specific SLR guidelines.
* **Conversion to SLR:** The SLR adhered to established reporting standards like PRISMA, ensuring transparency, reproducibility, and adherence to best practices in systematic reviews.

By following these steps in the conversion process, the researcher transformed an initial Literature Review on IoT into a well-structured and rigorous Systematic Literature Review, enhancing the quality and credibility of their research synthesis in the field of IoT.
