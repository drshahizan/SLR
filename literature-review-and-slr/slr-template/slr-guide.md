# ðŸ¥˜ Systematic Literature Review Guide

## 1. Select one or more databases

* Suggestions:
  * [Scopus](https://www-scopus-com.nuigalway.idm.oclc.org/search/form.uri?display=basic#basic) is the largest
  * [Web of Science](https://www-webofscience-com.nuigalway.idm.oclc.org/wos/woscc/basic-search) is the second largest
  * [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.nuigalway.idm.oclc.org/Xplore/home.jsp) is useful for technical/engineering conference papers
* Database tutorials/guides:
  * [Scopus](https://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a\_id/14799/c/10545/supporthub/scopus/)
  * [Web of Science](https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/support/wos/)
  * [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplorehelp/overview-of-ieee-xplore/about-content)

## 2. Define a search string

* Use the advanced search option
* Use terms related to your research
* Use the same search string in all selected databases
* Refine your search using boolean operators and filtering by author, title, abstract, topic, year, language, area, keywords, etc.
* Advanced search guides:
  * [Scopus](http://schema.elsevier.com/dtds/document/bkapi/search/SCOPUSSearchTips.htm)
  * [Web of Science](https://images.webofknowledge.com/images/help/WOS/contents.html)
  * [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplorehelp/searching-ieee-xplore/advanced-search)

## 3. Save your search

* Save your search and set to receive periodical updates to stay informed of the latest published articles
* Saving a search in different databases:
  * [Scopus](https://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a\_id/11227/supporthub/scopus/)
  * [Web of Science](https://images.webofknowledge.com/images/help/WOS/hp\_save\_search\_history.html)
  * [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplorehelp/personalization-settings/saved-searches)

## 4. Export the references

* Save the references found in spreadsheet format (Excel or CSV)
* When exporting on [Scopus](https://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a\_id/11234/supporthub/scopus/) (CSV), select "Citation information," "Bibliographical information," and "Abstract & Keywords"
* When exporting on [Web of Science](https://images.webofknowledge.com/images/help/WOS/hs\_output\_records.html) (Excel), select "Author, Title, Source, Abstract"
* When exporting on [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplorehelp/searching-ieee-xplore/search-results-page), select "Search results," and download the CSV file

## 5. Use a spreadsheet template

* Use a spreadsheet template to organize your findings
* Use the same template (such as the Scopus CSV file) to organize your references
* Update the data downloaded from other databases to match the template

## 6. Screen the results

* Organize your screening process using the spreadsheet template
* Do not delete the original results; keep different files for original and selected papers
* Screening order: title, abstract/keywords, full text
* Once the articles are selected by title and abstract/keywords, look for the full text
* The full text can be searched on the library website
* First, take a quick look at the papers (headings, pictures, tables, conclusions). If the paper is indeed interesting, read it more carefully

## 7. Download the selected papers

* Download only the selected papers, in PDF format

## 8. Read the articles

* After the screening process (title/abstract/keyword/full text), read all the selected papers

## 9. Use a reference manager

* Suggested reference manager: [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/guides/mendeley-reference-manager/)
* Upload the selected papers in PDF format to Mendeley
* Mendeley auto-generates the references
* If any references are wrong/incomplete, you can edit them

## 10. Cite the papers

* Use a reference manager plug-in for Word to cite the papers as you write
* Suggestion: [Mendeley Cite](https://www.mendeley.com/guides/mendeley-cite/)
* You can select the citation style you want in the plug-in
* The University of Galway suggests using the Harvard citation style
* Mendeley Cite also generates a bibliography section

## 11. Present your findings

* Use tables/plots to summarize your findings
* You can use analysis tools to present your results, such as [VOSviewer](https://www.vosviewer.com), [Excel pivot tables](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-pivottable-to-analyze-worksheet-data-a9a84538-bfe9-40a9-a8e9-f99134456576), and [Excel pivot charts](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-pivotchart-c1b1e057-6990-4c38-b52b-8255538e7b1c)

## 12. Follow previous review papers

* Use previous review papers, such as [Schulze et al. (2016)](https://search.library.nuigalway.ie/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=TN\_cdi\_swepub\_primary\_oai\_DiVA\_org\_liu\_123416\&context=PC\&vid=353GAL\_VUJ\&lang=en\_US\&search\_scope=PRIMO\_CENTRAL\&adaptor=primo\_central\_multiple\_fe\&tab=local\&query=any,contains,schulze%202016%20energy%20management%20review), as guidance
