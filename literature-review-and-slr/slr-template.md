# SLR Template

A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) template is a structured framework used for conducting and documenting a systematic review of existing research studies on a specific topic or research question. Systematic literature reviews are commonly used in academic and research settings to provide a comprehensive and unbiased summary of the available literature on a particular subject. Here's a template for conducting a systematic literature review:

**Systematic Literature Review (SLR) Template**

**1. Title:**

* Provide a clear and descriptive title for your systematic literature review.

**2. Objective:**

* State the main research question or objectives of the systematic literature review.

**3. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:**

* Define the criteria for selecting and excluding studies. This may include criteria related to publication date, study design, geographic location, and relevance to the research question.

**4. Search Strategy:**

* Describe the search strategy used to identify relevant studies, including databases searched, search terms, and any filters or limits applied.

**5. Study Selection Process:**

* Outline the process for screening and selecting studies, including how duplicates were handled and the number of reviewers involved.

**6. Data Extraction:**

* Specify the data extraction process, including the data items collected from each selected study (e.g., author, publication year, study design, key findings).

**7. Quality Assessment:**

* Explain how the quality or risk of bias of the included studies was assessed (e.g., using quality assessment tools or scales).

**8. Data Synthesis:**

* Describe how the data from the selected studies were synthesized and analyzed. This may include narrative synthesis, meta-analysis, or thematic analysis.

**9. Results:**

* Present the main findings of the systematic literature review, including key themes, trends, and conclusions drawn from the included studies.

**10. Discussion:** - Interpret the results in the context of the research question and objectives. Discuss the implications of the findings and any limitations of the review.

**11. Conclusion:** - Summarize the main contributions of the systematic literature review and provide recommendations for future research or practice.

**12. References:** - List all the studies included in the systematic literature review following a consistent citation style (e.g., APA, MLA).

**13. Appendices:** - Include any supplementary materials, such as flowcharts of the study selection process or data extraction forms.

**14. Acknowledgments:** - If applicable, acknowledge individuals or organizations that provided support or assistance during the review process.
