How To Write A Research Paper: Introduction
{% endembed %}

Writing a systematic literature review can feel like an overwhelming undertaking. After all, they can often take 6 to 18 months to complete. Below we‚Äôve prepared a step-by-step guide on how to write a systematic literature review.

Systematic literature review quick guide

1. Decide on your team.
2. Formulate your question.
3. Plan your research protocol.
4. Search for the literature.
5. Screen the literature.
6. Assess the quality of the studies.
7. Extract the data.
8. Analyze the results.
9. Interpret and present the results.

#### 1. **Decide on your team** <a href="#num-1-decide-on-your-team" id="num-1-decide-on-your-team"></a>

When carrying out a systematic literature review, you should employ multiple reviewers in order to minimize bias and strengthen analysis. A minimum of two is a good rule of thumb, with a third to serve as a tiebreaker if needed.

You may also need to team up with a librarian to help with the search, literature screeners, a statistician to analyze the data, and the relevant subject experts.

#### 2. **Formulate your question** <a href="#num-2-formulate-your-question" id="num-2-formulate-your-question"></a>

Define your answerable question. Then ask yourself, ‚Äúhas someone written a systematic literature review on my question already?‚Äù If so, yours may not be needed. A librarian can help you answer this.

You should formulate a ‚Äúwell-built clinical question.‚Äù This is the process of generating a good search question. To do this, run through PICO:

**PICO**

* **Patient or Population or Problem/Disease**: who or what is the question about? Are there factors about them (e.g. age, race) that could be relevant to the question you‚Äôre trying to answer?
* **Intervention**: which main intervention or treatment are you considering for assessment?
* **Comparison(s) or Control**: is there an alternative intervention or treatment you‚Äôre considering? Your systematic literature review doesn‚Äôt have to contain a comparison, but you‚Äôll want to stipulate at this stage, either way.
* **Outcome(s)**: what are you trying to measure or achieve? What‚Äôs the wider goal for the work you‚Äôll be doing?

#### 3. **Plan your research protocol** <a href="#num-3-plan-your-research-protocol" id="num-3-plan-your-research-protocol"></a>

Now you need a detailed strategy for how you‚Äôre going to search for and evaluate the studies relating to your question.

The protocol for your systematic literature review should include:

* the objectives of your project
* the specific methods and processes that you‚Äôll use
* the eligibility criteria of the individual studies
* how you plan to extract data from individual studies
* which analyses you‚Äôre going to carry out

For a full guide on how to systematically develop your protocol, take a look at the [PRISMA checklist](http://www.prisma-statement.org/documents/PRISMA-P-checklist.pdf). PRISMA has been designed primarily to improve the reporting of systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses.

#### 4. **Search for the literature** <a href="#num-4-search-for-the-literature" id="num-4-search-for-the-literature"></a>

When writing a systematic literature review, your goal is to find _all_ of the relevant studies relating to your question, so you need to search _thoroughly_.

This is where your librarian will come in handy again. They should be able to help you formulate a detailed search strategy, and point you to all of the best databases for your topic.

The places to consider in your search are electronic scientific databases (the most popular are [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), [MEDLINE](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medline/index.html), and [Embase](https://www.embase.com/landing?status=grey)), controlled clinical trial registers, non-English literature, raw data from published trials, references listed in primary sources, and unpublished sources known to experts in the field.

**Tip:** Don‚Äôt miss out on ‚Äúgray literature.‚Äù You‚Äôll improve the reliability of your findings by including it.
{% endhint %}

Don‚Äôt miss out on ‚Äúgray literature‚Äù sources: those sources outside of the usual academic publishing environment. They include:

* non-peer-reviewed journals
* pharmaceutical industry files
* conference proceedings
* pharmaceutical company websites
* internal reports

Gray literature sources are more likely to contain negative conclusions, so you‚Äôll improve the reliability of your findings by including it. You should document details such as:

* The databases you search and which years they cover
* The dates you first run the searches, and when they‚Äôre updated
* Which strategies you use, including search terms
* The numbers of results obtained

#### 5. **Screen the literature** <a href="#num-5-screen-the-literature" id="num-5-screen-the-literature"></a>

This should be performed by your two reviewers, using the criteria documented in your research protocol. The screening is done in two phases:

1. **Pre-screening** of all titles and abstracts, and selecting those appropriate
2. **Screening** of the full-text articles of the selected studies

Make sure reviewers keep a log of which studies they exclude, with reasons why.

#### 6. **Assess the quality of the studies** <a href="#num-6-assess-the-quality-of-the-studies" id="num-6-assess-the-quality-of-the-studies"></a>

Your reviewers should evaluate the methodological quality of your chosen full-text articles. Make an assessment checklist that closely aligns with your research protocol, including a consistent scoring system, calculations of the quality of each study, and sensitivity analysis.

The kinds of questions you'll come up with are:

* Were the participants really randomly allocated to their groups?
* Were the groups similar in terms of prognostic factors?
* Could the conclusions of the study have been influenced by bias?

#### 7. **Extract the data** <a href="#num-7-extract-the-data" id="num-7-extract-the-data"></a>

Every step of the data extraction must be documented for transparency and replicability. Create a data extraction form and set your reviewers to work extracting data from the qualified studies.

Here‚Äôs a [free detailed template](https://dal.ca.libguides.com/ld.php?content\_id=14553990) for recording data extraction, from Dalhousie University. It should be adapted to your specific question.

#### 8. **Analyze the results** <a href="#num-8-analyze-the-results" id="num-8-analyze-the-results"></a>

Establish a standard measure of outcome which can be applied to each study on the basis of its effect size.

Measures of outcome for studies with:

* Binary outcomes (e.g. cured/not cured) are odds ratio and risk ratio
* Continuous outcomes (e.g. blood pressure) are means, difference in means, and standardized difference in means
* Survival or time-to-event data are hazard ratios

Design a table and populate it with your data results. Draw this out into a [forest plot](https://uk.cochrane.org/news/how-read-forest-plot), which provides a simple visual representation of variation between the studies.

Then analyze the data for issues. These can include heterogeneity, which is when studies‚Äô lines within the forest plot don‚Äôt overlap with any other studies. Again, record any excluded studies here for reference.

#### 9. **Interpret and present the results** <a href="#num-9-interpret-and-present-the-results" id="num-9-interpret-and-present-the-results"></a>

Consider different factors when interpreting your results. These include limitations, strength of evidence, biases, applicability, economic effects, and implications for future practice or research.

Apply appropriate grading of your evidence and consider the strength of your recommendations.

It‚Äôs best to formulate a detailed plan for how you‚Äôll present your systematic review results. Take a look at these [guidelines for interpreting results](https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current/chapter-15) from the Cochrane Institute.

### Frequently Asked Questions about writing a systematic literature review <a href="#faq" id="faq"></a>

<details>

<summary>üéØ Why do a systematic literature review?</summary>

Systematic literature reviews are often found in clinical or healthcare settings. Medical professionals read systematic literature reviews to stay up-to-date in their field and granting agencies sometimes need them to make sure there‚Äôs justification for further research in an area.
