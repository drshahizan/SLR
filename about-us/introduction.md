# Introduction

A systematic literature review (SLR) identifies, selects and critically appraises research in order to answer a clearly formulated question (Dewey, A. & Drahota, A. 2016). The systematic review should follow a clearly defined protocol or plan where the criteria is clearly stated before the review is conducted.

Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) are crucial in computer science research for several reasons:

1. **Identifying Existing Knowledge:** SLRs help researchers identify and synthesize the existing body of knowledge on a particular topic. In computer science, where technology evolves rapidly, it's essential to stay updated on the latest research and understand the state of the art.
2. **Avoiding Redundancy:** Without a systematic review, researchers may inadvertently duplicate existing work. An SLR ensures that the research is novel and doesn't replicate previous efforts.
3. **Informed Decision-Making:** SLRs provide a comprehensive view of the field, enabling researchers to make informed decisions about research directions, methodologies, and areas that need further exploration.
4. **Quality Assurance:** Through a rigorous process of study selection and evaluation, SLRs ensure that only high-quality research is included. This helps in maintaining the quality and credibility of the research.
5. **Evidence-Based Research:** SLRs provide a solid foundation of evidence upon which new research can be built. This evidence-based approach enhances the rigor and validity of computer science research.

Here's a case study illustrating the importance of an SLR in computer science research:

**Case Study: Improving Web Security through SLR**

_Background:_ A team of computer science researchers is interested in improving web security. They want to develop a new security mechanism but want to ensure it's both innovative and grounded in existing knowledge.

_Importance of SLR:_

1. **Understanding Current Approaches:** The researchers start by conducting an SLR to understand the current state of web security in computer science. They collect and analyze existing research papers, articles, and reports on web security.
2. **Identifying Gaps:** Through the SLR, the researchers identify several gaps in the existing literature. They find that while there are many studies on specific aspects of web security (e.g., encryption, authentication), there is a lack of comprehensive research that integrates these aspects into a holistic security framework.
3. **Validating the Need for Innovation:** The SLR reveals that the current web security solutions have limitations and vulnerabilities. This validates the need for the researchers' proposed security mechanism.
4. **Informed Design:** Armed with the insights from the SLR, the researchers design their security mechanism. They incorporate the best practices and lessons learned from existing literature, ensuring that their solution addresses the identified gaps and vulnerabilities.
5. **Enhanced Credibility:** When the researchers publish their work, they can reference the SLR in their introduction to establish the context and need for their research. This enhances the credibility of their work, as it's based on a comprehensive review of existing knowledge.

In this case, the systematic literature review played a pivotal role in guiding the researchers' work, ensuring that their new web security mechanism was well-informed, innovative, and aligned with the current state of computer science research in the field of web security.
