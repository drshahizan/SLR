### **Where are systematic** literature **reviews used?** <a href="#where-are-systematic-literature-reviews-used" id="where-are-systematic-literature-reviews-used"></a>

Systematic literature reviews can be utilized in various contexts, but they’re often relied on in clinical or healthcare settings.

Medical professionals read systematic literature reviews to stay up-to-date in their field, and granting agencies sometimes need them to make sure there’s justification for further research in an area. They can even be used as the starting point for developing clinical practice guidelines.

### **What types of systematic** literature **review are there?** <a href="#what-types-of-systematic-literature-review-are-there" id="what-types-of-systematic-literature-review-are-there"></a>

A classic systematic literature review can take different approaches:

* **Effectiveness reviews** assess the extent to which a medical intervention or therapy achieves its intended effect. They’re the most common type of systematic literature review.
* **Diagnostic test accuracy reviews** produce a summary of diagnostic test performance so that their accuracy can be determined before use by healthcare professionals.
* **Experiential (qualitative) reviews** analyze human experiences in a cultural or social context. They can be used to assess the effectiveness of an intervention from a person-centric perspective.
* **Costs/economics evaluation reviews** look at the cost implications of an intervention or procedure, to assess the resources needed to implement it.
* **Etiology/risk reviews** usually try to determine to what degree a relationship exists between an exposure and a health outcome. This can be used to better inform healthcare planning and resource allocation.
* **Psychometric reviews** assess the quality of health measurement tools so that the best instrument can be selected for use.
* **Prevalence/incidence reviews** measure both the proportion of a population who have a disease, and how often the disease occurs.
* **Prognostic reviews** examine the course of a disease and its potential outcomes.
* **Expert opinion/policy reviews** are based around expert narrative or policy. They’re often used to complement, or in the absence of, quantitative data.
* **Methodology systematic reviews** can be carried out to analyze any methodological issues in the design, conduct, or review of research studies.

### **How to write a systematic** literature **review** <a href="#how-to-write-a-systematic-literature-review" id="how-to-write-a-systematic-literature-review"></a>

Writing a systematic literature review can feel like an overwhelming undertaking. After all, they can often take 6 to 18 months to complete. Below we’ve prepared a step-by-step guide on how to write a systematic literature review.

Systematic literature review quick guide

1. Decide on your team.
2. Formulate your question.
3. Plan your research protocol.
4. Search for the literature.
5. Screen the literature.
6. Assess the quality of the studies.
7. Extract the data.
8. Analyze the results.
9. Interpret and present the results.

#### 1. **Decide on your team** <a href="#num-1-decide-on-your-team" id="num-1-decide-on-your-team"></a>

When carrying out a systematic literature review, you should employ multiple reviewers in order to minimize bias and strengthen analysis. A minimum of two is a good rule of thumb, with a third to serve as a tiebreaker if needed.

You may also need to team up with a librarian to help with the search, literature screeners, a statistician to analyze the data, and the relevant subject experts.

#### 2. **Formulate your question** <a href="#num-2-formulate-your-question" id="num-2-formulate-your-question"></a>

Define your answerable question. Then ask yourself, “has someone written a systematic literature review on my question already?” If so, yours may not be needed. A librarian can help you answer this.

You should formulate a “well-built clinical question.” This is the process of generating a good search question. To do this, run through PICO:

PICO

* **Patient or Population or Problem/Disease**: who or what is the question about? Are there factors about them (e.g. age, race) that could be relevant to the question you’re trying to answer?
* **Intervention**: which main intervention or treatment are you considering for assessment?
* **Comparison(s) or Control**: is there an alternative intervention or treatment you’re considering? Your systematic literature review doesn’t have to contain a comparison, but you’ll want to stipulate at this stage, either way.
* **Outcome(s)**: what are you trying to measure or achieve? What’s the wider goal for the work you’ll be doing?

#### 3. **Plan your research protocol** <a href="#num-3-plan-your-research-protocol" id="num-3-plan-your-research-protocol"></a>

Now you need a detailed strategy for how you’re going to search for and evaluate the studies relating to your question.

The protocol for your systematic literature review should include:

* the objectives of your project
* the specific methods and processes that you’ll use
* the eligibility criteria of the individual studies
* how you plan to extract data from individual studies
* which analyses you’re going to carry out

For a full guide on how to systematically develop your protocol, take a look at the [PRISMA checklist](http://www.prisma-statement.org/documents/PRISMA-P-checklist.pdf). PRISMA has been designed primarily to improve the reporting of systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses.

#### 4. **Search for the literature** <a href="#num-4-search-for-the-literature" id="num-4-search-for-the-literature"></a>

When writing a systematic literature review, your goal is to find _all_ of the relevant studies relating to your question, so you need to search _thoroughly_.

This is where your librarian will come in handy again. They should be able to help you formulate a detailed search strategy, and point you to all of the best databases for your topic.

➡️ Read more on on [how to efficiently search research databases](https://paperpile.com/g/search-online-research-database/).

The places to consider in your search are electronic scientific databases (the most popular are [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), [MEDLINE](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medline/index.html), and [Embase](https://www.embase.com/landing?status=grey)), controlled clinical trial registers, non-English literature, raw data from published trials, references listed in primary sources, and unpublished sources known to experts in the field.

➡️ Take a look at our list of [the top academic research databases](https://paperpile.com/g/academic-research-databases/).

**Tip:** Don’t miss out on “gray literature.” You’ll improve the reliability of your findings by including it.

Don’t miss out on “gray literature” sources: those sources outside of the usual academic publishing environment. They include:

* non-peer-reviewed journals
* pharmaceutical industry files
* conference proceedings
* pharmaceutical company websites
* internal reports

Gray literature sources are more likely to contain negative conclusions, so you’ll improve the reliability of your findings by including it. You should document details such as:

* The databases you search and which years they cover
* The dates you first run the searches, and when they’re updated
* Which strategies you use, including search terms
* The numbers of results obtained

➡️ Read more about [gray literature](https://paperpile.com/g/grey-literature/).

#### 5. **Screen the literature** <a href="#num-5-screen-the-literature" id="num-5-screen-the-literature"></a>

This should be performed by your two reviewers, using the criteria documented in your research protocol. The screening is done in two phases:

1. **Pre-screening** of all titles and abstracts, and selecting those appropriate
2. **Screening** of the full-text articles of the selected studies

Make sure reviewers keep a log of which studies they exclude, with reasons why.

➡️ Visit our guide on [what is an abstract?](https://paperpile.com/g/what-is-the-abstract-of-a-paper/)

#### 6. **Assess the quality of the studies** <a href="#num-6-assess-the-quality-of-the-studies" id="num-6-assess-the-quality-of-the-studies"></a>

Your reviewers should evaluate the methodological quality of your chosen full-text articles. Make an assessment checklist that closely aligns with your research protocol, including a consistent scoring system, calculations of the quality of each study, and sensitivity analysis.

The kinds of questions you'll come up with are:

* Were the participants really randomly allocated to their groups?
* Were the groups similar in terms of prognostic factors?
* Could the conclusions of the study have been influenced by bias?

#### 7. **Extract the data** <a href="#num-7-extract-the-data" id="num-7-extract-the-data"></a>

Every step of the data extraction must be documented for transparency and replicability. Create a data extraction form and set your reviewers to work extracting data from the qualified studies.

Here’s a [free detailed template](https://dal.ca.libguides.com/ld.php?content\_id=14553990) for recording data extraction, from Dalhousie University. It should be adapted to your specific question.

#### 8. **Analyze the results** <a href="#num-8-analyze-the-results" id="num-8-analyze-the-results"></a>

Establish a standard measure of outcome which can be applied to each study on the basis of its effect size.

Measures of outcome for studies with:

* Binary outcomes (e.g. cured/not cured) are odds ratio and risk ratio
* Continuous outcomes (e.g. blood pressure) are means, difference in means, and standardized difference in means
* Survival or time-to-event data are hazard ratios

Design a table and populate it with your data results. Draw this out into a [forest plot](https://uk.cochrane.org/news/how-read-forest-plot), which provides a simple visual representation of variation between the studies.

Then analyze the data for issues. These can include heterogeneity, which is when studies’ lines within the forest plot don’t overlap with any other studies. Again, record any excluded studies here for reference.

#### 9. **Interpret and present the results** <a href="#num-9-interpret-and-present-the-results" id="num-9-interpret-and-present-the-results"></a>

Consider different factors when interpreting your results. These include limitations, strength of evidence, biases, applicability, economic effects, and implications for future practice or research.

Apply appropriate grading of your evidence and consider the strength of your recommendations.

It’s best to formulate a detailed plan for how you’ll present your systematic review results. Take a look at these [guidelines for interpreting results](https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current/chapter-15) from the Cochrane Institute.

### **Registering your systematic** literature **review** <a href="#registering-your-systematic-literature-review" id="registering-your-systematic-literature-review"></a>

Before writing your systematic literature review, you can register it with [OSF](https://osf.io/prereg/) for additional guidance along the way. You could also register your completed work with [PROSPERO](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/).
