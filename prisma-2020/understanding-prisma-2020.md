# Understanding PRISMA 2020

The **PRISMA 2020** ([Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses](https://www.prisma-statement.org/)) is a robust framework designed to guide researchers in conducting systematic reviews. It goes beyond the scope of regular literature reviews, which are essentially summaries of existing research on a particular topic. In contrast, a systematic review is a comprehensive and methodical exploration of the literature, specifically geared towards answering a well-defined research question.

### **Key Characteristics of Systematic Reviews**:

* **Comprehensive Approach**: Systematic reviews aim to leave no stone unturned. They involve the meticulous discovery, categorization, assessment, and synthesis of all relevant prior research on a specific research question.
* **Unbiased and Well-documented**: The hallmark of a systematic review is its commitment to impartiality and transparency. Researchers strive to approach the literature without bias and meticulously document their methodology and findings.
* **Synthesis of Evidence**: Systematic reviews seek to synthesize the body of evidence, providing a cohesive and structured overview of the existing research. This synthesis enables researchers and readers to draw meaningful conclusions.

### **Expanding Beyond Medicine**:

While systematic reviews have traditionally been prominent in medicine and the health sciences, they are increasingly gaining recognition and utilization in various other academic disciplines. Researchers in fields like social sciences, environmental sciences, and more are adopting systematic review methodologies to provide well-structured and evidence-based insights.

### PRISMA Flow Diagram

PRISMA 2020 introduces an enhanced flow diagram that accommodates various scenarios. It offers expanded options depending on where you conduct your search and whether you are updating a review. There are two main versions of the PRISMA 2020 flow diagram:

1. **Version 1**: This version includes databases and clinical trial or preprint registers. It caters to a standard systematic review that involves searching established databases and sources.
2. **Version 2**: Provides additional sections for elaborating on your grey literature search. This encompasses searches beyond traditional databases, such as websites and citation lists. It offers a more comprehensive depiction of the review process.

Researchers can choose the appropriate PRISMA 2020 flow diagram version based on the nature of their review and the sources they explore. These flow diagrams serve as valuable tools for structuring and reporting the systematic review process, enhancing transparency, and facilitating the dissemination of research findings.

The flow diagram depicts the flow of information through the different phases of a systematic review. It maps out the number of records identified, included and excluded, and the reasons for exclusions. Different templates are available depending on the type of review (new or updated) and sources used to identify studies.
