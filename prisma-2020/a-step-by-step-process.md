# A step-by-step process

Using the PRISMA 2020 (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines involves a step-by-step process to ensure that your systematic review or meta-analysis is reported transparently and comprehensively. Below are the key steps to follow when using PRISMA 2020:

**1. Understand the PRISMA 2020 Checklist:** Familiarize yourself with the PRISMA 2020 Checklist and its 27 essential items. You can access the checklist and an explanation of each item from the official PRISMA website or publication.

**2. Plan Your Systematic Review:** Before starting your review, clearly define your research question, objectives, and inclusion/exclusion criteria for selecting studies. Ensure that your research question aligns with the PRISMA 2020 framework.

**3. Develop a Protocol:** Create a systematic review protocol that outlines the methodology you'll use, including search strategies, data extraction methods, and the approach to assessing risk of bias (if applicable). Register your protocol on a relevant platform like PROSPERO.

**4. Conduct the Literature Search:** Search for relevant studies using a systematic and comprehensive approach. Document the search strategy, databases used, search terms, and any filters applied. Ensure that your search covers the time period and study designs specified in your protocol.

**5. Study Selection:** Implement your inclusion/exclusion criteria to screen and select studies. Maintain detailed records of the screening process, including reasons for exclusion.

**6. Data Extraction:** Extract data from the selected studies using a predefined template. Include information on study characteristics, outcomes, and any other relevant data points. Ensure that your data extraction process is consistent and well-documented.

**7. Risk of Bias Assessment:** If applicable, assess the risk of bias in the included studies. Use appropriate tools or criteria and clearly report the results of the assessment.

**8. Data Synthesis and Meta-Analysis:** If relevant, conduct data synthesis and meta-analysis. Follow established statistical methods and guidelines for pooling data, calculating effect sizes, and assessing heterogeneity.

**9. Report According to PRISMA 2020:** When writing your systematic review or meta-analysis manuscript, ensure that you follow the PRISMA 2020 Checklist. Address each of the 27 items in the checklist in your manuscript. This includes providing clear information on your research question, search strategy, inclusion/exclusion criteria, data extraction process, risk of bias assessment, and results.

**10. Transparency and Supplementary Materials:** Provide supplementary materials such as a PRISMA flow diagram showing the study selection process and a summary table of included studies. These add to the transparency of your review.

**11. Peer Review and Revision:** Submit your manuscript to a peer-reviewed journal that accepts systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Be prepared to respond to reviewers' comments and make necessary revisions to adhere to PRISMA 2020.

**12. Publish and Share:** Once your systematic review or meta-analysis is accepted and published, consider sharing it on platforms like PROSPERO or other relevant databases for greater visibility.

Throughout the process, maintaining transparency, consistency, and adherence to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines will help ensure that your systematic review or meta-analysis is of high quality and can be effectively used by researchers, policymakers, and practitioners in your field.
