# Sample SLR Articles

Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) are a cornerstone of rigorous academic research, particularly in the field of computer science. These comprehensive reviews systematically collect, evaluate, and synthesize existing literature to address specific research questions or explore particular topics. In this collection, we present a selection of sample SLR articles that exemplify the diversity and depth of research within the realm of computer science.

1.  [**Improving Reading Through Videogames and Digital Apps: A Systematic Review**](https://github.com/drshahizan/research-material/blob/main/SLR/slr1.pdf)

    This SLR delves into the intriguing intersection of technology and education, exploring how videogames and digital applications can enhance reading skills. By analyzing a broad range of literature, this article sheds light on the potential benefits of incorporating digital tools into literacy development.


2.  [**Systematic Review of CLIL in Computer Science: Past, Present, and Future — with a Special Focus on Using ICT**](https://github.com/drshahizan/research-material/blob/main/SLR/slr2.pdf)

    Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) in computer science is the focal point of this systematic review. It not only traces the historical trajectory of CLIL but also peers into the future, emphasizing the role of information and communication technology (ICT) in this educational approach.


3.  [**Machine Learning Approaches to Bike-Sharing Systems: A Systematic Literature Review**](https://github.com/drshahizan/research-material/blob/main/SLR/slr3.pdf)

    This systematic literature review investigates machine learning techniques applied to bike-sharing systems. It synthesizes research findings to provide an overview of the current state of machine learning in this context.\

4.  [**Liberati A, Altman DG, Tetzlaff J, et al. The PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies that evaluate health care interventions: explanation and elaboration**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19631507/)**.**

    These references provide essential guidance for researchers embarking on systematic reviews. They include seminal papers explaining the PRISMA statement—a crucial framework for transparently reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses. These resources are indispensable for maintaining high research standards.


5.  [**Page MJ, Moher D, Bossuyt P, et al. PRISMA 2020 explanation and elaboration: updated guidance and exemplars for reporting systematic reviews.**](https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/gwdhk/)

    This article provides an updated and detailed explanation of the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, offering valuable guidance and examples for researchers reporting systematic reviews.\

6.  [**Rethlefsen M, Kirtley S, Waffenschmidt S, et al. PRISMA-S: An Extension to the PRISMA Statement for Reporting Literature Searches in Systematic Reviews.**](https://osf.io/sfc38/)

    PRISMA-S is an extension to the PRISMA statement, focusing on reporting the literature search process within systematic reviews. This document provides guidance on transparently reporting literature searches.\
