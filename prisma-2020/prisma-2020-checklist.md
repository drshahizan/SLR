# PRISMA 2020 Checklist

The PRISMA 2020 (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) Checklist is a set of guidelines and recommendations developed to help researchers and authors improve the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses in various fields, including healthcare, social sciences, and other research domains. PRISMA 2020 is an update to the original PRISMA guidelines, which were first introduced in 2009.

The PRISMA 2020 Checklist consists of 27 essential items that authors should consider when preparing and reporting their systematic reviews and meta-analyses. These items cover various aspects of the research process, from the initial planning and design of the review to the presentation of results. The checklist provides a structured framework to ensure transparency, accuracy, and completeness in reporting these types of research studies.

Here are some key areas covered by the PRISMA 2020 Checklist:

1. **Title and Abstract**: Guidelines for clear and informative titles and abstracts that accurately represent the scope and objectives of the review.
2. **Rationale**: Explanation of the rationale for conducting the systematic review or meta-analysis, including the research question and objectives.
3. **Eligibility Criteria**: Specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria for studies included in the review.
4. **Information Sources**: Documentation of the sources used to search for relevant studies, including databases, search strategies, and any additional resources.
5. **Study Selection**: Description of the process for selecting studies, including screening and eligibility assessments.
6. **Data Collection**: Explanation of data extraction methods and the types of data collected from included studies.
7. **Risk of Bias**: Assessment of the risk of bias in individual studies and the methods used for this assessment.
8. **Data Synthesis**: Explanation of the statistical methods used for data synthesis, such as meta-analysis, if applicable.
9. **Results**: Presentation of the main findings, including effect sizes, confidence intervals, and other relevant data.
10. **Discussion**: Interpretation of results, implications, and limitations of the review.
11. **Funding**: Disclosure of funding sources and conflicts of interest.

The PRISMA 2020 Checklist is a valuable resource for authors and researchers undertaking systematic reviews and meta-analyses, as it helps ensure that their research is transparent, reproducible, and of high quality. Adhering to these guidelines enhances the clarity and reliability of systematic review publications, ultimately contributing to evidence-based decision-making in various fields of research.
