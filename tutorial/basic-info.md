A systematic literature review is a rigorous and transparent way of synthesizing the existing knowledge on a specific topic. It can help you identify gaps, evaluate the quality, and compare the results of different studies. To write a systematic literature review, you need to follow a clear and reproducible protocol that consists of several steps. Here is a possible outline of the steps, based on the sources I found¬π¬≤¬≥:

1. **Formulate a research question**: This is the first and most important step, as it defines the scope and purpose of your review. You need to specify the main topic, the population, the intervention, the comparison, and the outcome of interest. You can use the PICO framework to help you structure your question‚Å¥.
2. **Develop a review protocol**: This is a document that describes the methods and criteria you will use to conduct your review. It should include the search strategy, the selection criteria, the quality assessment, the data extraction, the data synthesis, and the dissemination plan. You can use a template or a checklist to guide you in writing your protocol‚Åµ‚Å∂.
3. **Search for the literature**: This is the step where you identify and retrieve all the relevant studies that answer your research question. You need to use multiple sources, such as databases, journals, websites, and reference lists. You also need to use appropriate keywords, operators, and filters to refine your search. You should document your search process and results in a table or a flowchart‚Å∑.
4. **Screen the literature**: This is the step where you apply your selection criteria to the studies you found and decide which ones to include or exclude in your review. You need to justify your decisions and report any disagreements or conflicts. You can use a software tool or a spreadsheet to help you manage your screening process.
5. **Assess the quality of the studies**: This is the step where you evaluate the methodological rigor and validity of the studies you included in your review. You need to use a standardized tool or a checklist to assess the quality of each study and assign a score or a rating. You should also report any sources of bias or heterogeneity among the studies.
6. **Extract the data**: This is the step where you collect and summarize the relevant information from the studies you included in your review. You need to use a predefined form or a table to extract the data, such as the study characteristics, the methods, the results, and the conclusions. You should also report any missing or inconsistent data.
7. **Synthesize the data**: This is the step where you analyze and integrate the data you extracted from the studies and draw conclusions about your research question. You can use a narrative, a descriptive, or a quantitative approach to synthesize the data, depending on the type and quality of the studies. You can also use graphical or statistical methods to visualize or combine the data, such as tables, charts, or meta-analysis.
8. **Write and publish a report**: This is the final step where you present and disseminate the findings and implications of your review. You need to follow a clear and structured format to write your report, such as the PRISMA guidelines. You should also include a summary, an introduction, a methods section, a results section, a discussion section, and a conclusion section. You can submit your report to a journal, a conference, or a repository for publication.
9. **Update your review**: This is an optional but recommended step where you monitor and update your review to reflect the latest evidence and developments on your topic. You need to decide on the frequency and the criteria for updating your review, and repeat some or all of the previous steps accordingly. You should also report any changes or additions to your review protocol or report.
